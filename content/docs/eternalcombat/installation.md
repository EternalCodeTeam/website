## 💥 Warning!

When managing a Minecraft server, it's important to remember about safety. Therefore, we recommend not using the `/reload` command or plugins reloading in real-time such as PlugMan, as they may cause problems with plugins and lead to unexpected errors.

Please note that the use of these features is at your own risk, and we are not responsible for any damages caused to the server as a result of their use.

Thank you for using our documentation. We wish you success in deploying the EternalCombat plugin on your Minecraft server! 😊
