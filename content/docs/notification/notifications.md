# üí¨üîî Notifications

This plugin allows sending messages to different parts of Minecraft, including the chat, action bar, title, and subtitle. All messages can be formatted using [üîç MiniMessages](https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage/format.html) or standard color codes. You can also use an online [üåê message viewer](https://webui.adventure.kyori.net/)

<Alert type="tip" title="TIP">
Try our [interactive notification generator](/notification-generator) to create and preview your notifications before adding them to your configuration!

### Examples combining multiple notifications:

<Alert type="tip" title="TIP">
üëë Unleash your creativity and design your own custom notifications without any limits!
</Alert>

Here's an example of an advanced notification that combines multiple notification types:

```yaml
# Advanced notification example
advanced_notification:
  # Chat message with multiple lines
  chat:
    - "<gradient:gold:yellow>Welcome to the server!</gradient>"
    - "<gray>Use <click:run_command:/help><hover:show_text:Click to see help><gold>/help</gold></hover></click> for assistance.</gray>"
  
  # Action bar notification
  actionbar: "<gradient:aqua:blue>You have <gold>5</gold> unread messages</gradient>"
  
  # Title and subtitle with custom times
  title: "<gradient:red:dark_red>WARNING!</gradient>"
  subtitle: "<gray>You are entering a PvP zone</gray>"
  times: "0.5s 3s 1s"  # Fade in, stay, fade out
  
  # Sound effect with custom volume and pitch
  sound: "ENTITY_ENDER_DRAGON_GROWL MASTER 1.0 0.8"
  
  # Clear any existing title/subtitle before showing this one
  titleHide: true
```

This example demonstrates:
- Multi-line chat messages with gradients and clickable elements
- Action bar notifications with gradients
- Title and subtitle with custom fade times
- Sound effects with custom volume and pitch
- Title clearing before showing new notifications

You can mix and match these elements to create your own custom notifications!
