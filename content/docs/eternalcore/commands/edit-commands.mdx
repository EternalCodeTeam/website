## ✏️ Edit Commands in EternalCore

EternalCore allows you to fully customize command names, aliases, permissions, and subcommands through the `commands.yml` file.

## 🗂️ Location of the file

```text
/plugins/EternalCore/commands.yml
```

---

## 🧩 What can be changed?

You can modify:

* Command name (e.g. `/eternalcore` → `/eternal-core`)
* Aliases (e.g. `/ec`, `/eternal`)
* Required permissions
* Subcommands (name, aliases, permissions, or disable entirely)

---

## 🔧 Example configuration

```yaml
commands:
  eternalcore:
    name: "eternal-core" # this is the new main command name
    enabled: true
    aliases:
      - "eternal" # list of new aliases for the main command
    permissions:
      - "eternalcore.eternalcore" # permission required to use the main command
    subCommands:
      reload: # this must match the name of the subcommand you want to edit
        name: "reload" # this is the new subcommand name (keep the same if unchanged)
        enabled: true
        aliases:
          - "rl" # list of new aliases for the subcommand
        permissions:
          - "eternalcore.reload" # permission required to use the subcommand
```

---

## ✅ Result of this configuration

* `/eternalcore` becomes `/eternal-core`
* New alias `/eternal` is added
* The `/eternal-core reload` command can now also be run using `/eternal-core rl`
* Both commands require custom permissions

---

## 🛑 Disable a subcommand (optional)

You can also disable a specific subcommand by setting:

```yaml
enabled: false
```

inside the subcommand section.
