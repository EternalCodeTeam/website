## ❌ Disable Commands in EternalCore

EternalCore (and most EternalCode plugins) allows you to disable specific commands using the `commands.yml` configuration file.

import { AlertBox } from "../../../components/ui/alert-box";

<AlertBox type="important">
  You must **restart the server** after making any changes to this file. Reload is not enough.
</AlertBox>

## 🗂️ Location of the file

```text
/plugins/EternalCore/commands.yml
```

---

## 🚫 How to disable a command

To disable a specific command — for example, `/rtp` — you need to add a section like this in `commands.yml`:

```yaml
rtp:
  name: []
  enabled: false
  aliases: []
  permissions: []
  subCommands: []
```

📌 In this case, `rtp` is the **original command name**, not an alias.

---

## ⚠️ Warnings and Tips

* ❗ **Do not use an alias.** You must use the original command name exactly as it is defined by the plugin.
* 🔁 Changes require a **server restart** to take effect.
* ✅ You can safely disable *any* built-in command if you want to replace it with your own or just remove access.
