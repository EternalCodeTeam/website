## 🧙‍♂️📝 The magic docs system for developers

> If you are a developer, you can use our docs system in your [PR's! 😍🙌](https://github.com/EternalCodeTeam/EternalCore/compare)

Docs system is a tool that allows developers to place information about their code directly into the source file using annotations. These annotations are then processed by the system and converted into JSON files that can be used to create graphical documentation of the project.

For more information, search for [@FeatureDocs](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AEternalCodeTeam%2FEternalCore%20%40FeatureDocs&type=code) and [@DocsDescription](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AEternalCodeTeam%2FEternalCore+%40DocsDescription&type=code) annotations in our repository.
