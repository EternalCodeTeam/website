## üì¢ MOTD ‚Äî Message of the Day

The Message of the Day (MOTD) feature displays a custom welcome message to players when they join the server. This can include server rules, announcements, or greetings.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The MOTD is configured in the EternalCore's appropriate messages files, e.g. `en_messages.yml`, `pl_messages.yml`

You can customize:
- The message content (supports color codes and placeholders)
- Formatting and styling

Default configuration:
```yaml
# This section is responsible for the messages of the MOTD feature.
motd:
  # Message of the Day (MOTD) content that will be sent to players when they join the server.
  # Out of the box supported placeholders: {PLAYER}, {WORLD}
  # You can add your own placeholders using the PlaceholderAPI.
  # You can check our Notification Generator: https://www.eternalcode.pl/notification-generator
