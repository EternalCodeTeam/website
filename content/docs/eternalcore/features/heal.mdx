## ❤️ Heal — restore health and hunger

The `/heal` command instantly heals a player to their maximum health and refills their hunger bar. It can be used on yourself or on another player (if you have permission).

### ✅ Basic usage

```text
/heal [player]
```

- Without `[player]` the command heals the executor.
- Providing `[player]` requires the `eternalcore.heal.other` permission.

### 🎯 Examples

```text
/heal
→ You have been healed to full and hunger restored

/heal Notch
→ Healed Notch to full health and hunger (staff only)
```

## ℹ️ Notes

- Permission: `eternalcore.heal` (self), `eternalcore.heal.other` (other players).
- Healing is immediate and will restore both health and hunger to their maximum values.
