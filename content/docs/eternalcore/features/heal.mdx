## ❤️ Heal — restore health and hunger

The `/heal` command instantly heals a player to their maximum health and refills their hunger bar. It can be used on yourself or on another player (if you have permission).
Required permissions:
- `eternalcore.heal` - to heal yourself.
- `eternalcore.heal.other` - to heal other players.

### ✅ Usage

```text
/heal [player]
```
<AlertBox type="warning">
  - Without `[player]` the command heals the executor.
  - Providing `[player]` requires the `eternalcore.heal.other` permission.
</AlertBox>
