## Introduction

The `/heal` command instantly heals a player to their maximum health and refills their hunger bar. It can be used on yourself or on another player.

## Usage

```text
/heal [player]
```

<AlertBox type="warning" title="Note">
  - Without `[player]` the command heals the executor.
  - Providing `[player]` heals the target player.
