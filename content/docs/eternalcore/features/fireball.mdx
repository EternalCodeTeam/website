## Launch Fireballs with /fireball Command
The `/fireball` command allows server staff to launch fireballs at players or entities, adding an exciting dynamic to gameplay. This can be used for fun, challenges, or even as a form of punishment.
### Usage
To use the command, type `/fireball <speed>`. The fireball will be launched in the direction you are facing.
The `<speed>` parameter controls its speed: higher values are faster, and negative values launch it backward.
