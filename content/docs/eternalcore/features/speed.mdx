## 🏃 Speed — adjust movement speed

The `/speed` command modifies a player's walking or flying speed. This is useful for staff, builders, or players with special permissions.

### ✅ Basic usage

```text
/speed <1-10> [player]
/speed <walk|fly> <1-10> [player]
```

- Speed values range from 1 (normal) to 10 (very fast).
- Without specifying `walk` or `fly`, adjusts the current movement type.
- Default speed is 1 (normal Minecraft speed).

### 🎯 Examples

```text
/speed 5
→ Your movement speed has been set to 5

/speed walk 3
→ Your walking speed has been set to 3

/speed fly 7 Notch
→ Notch's flying speed has been set to 7

/speed 1
→ Reset to normal speed
```

## ℹ️ Notes

- Permission: `eternalcore.speed` (self), `eternalcore.speed.other` (others).
- Speed affects both walking and flying depending on the current mode.
- Very high speeds can make controls difficult and may cause lag (e.g. chunks render is too slow compared to player's speed).
- Speed 1 is the normal Minecraft speed; speed 10 is approximately 10x faster.
- Decimal points are allowed (e.g. `/speed 2.5`).
