## Introduction

The `/speed` command modifies a player's walking or flying speed. This is useful for staff, builders, or players with special permissions.

## Usage

```text
/speed <1-10> [player]
/speed <walk|fly> <1-10> [player]
```

- Speed values range from 1 (slow) to 10 (very fast).
- Without specifying `walk` or `fly`, adjusts the current movement type.
- Default speed is 2 (normal Minecraft speed).

## Examples

```text
/speed 5
→ Your movement speed has been set to 5

/speed walk 3
→ Your walking speed has been set to 3

/speed fly 7 Notch
→ Notch's flying speed has been set to 7

/speed 1
→ Reset to normal speed
```

## Notes

- Speed affects both walking and flying depending on the current mode.
- Very high speeds can make controls difficult and may cause lag.
- Speed 2 is the normal Minecraft speed; speed 10 is approximately 5x faster.
- Decimal points are allowed (e.g. `/speed 2.5`).
