## Introduction

The `/burn` command enables server staff to set a player on fire for a specified duration, measured in ticks. This can be useful for various gameplay scenarios, such as punishments or challenges.

## Usage

Use `/burn <player> <ticks>` to set a player on fire, or `/burn <ticks>` to set yourself on fire.
The duration is specified in ticks (20 ticks = 1 second).
