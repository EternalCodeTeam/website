## Set Players on Fire with /burn Command
The `/burn` command enables server staff to set a player on fire for a specified duration, measured in ticks. This can be useful for various gameplay scenarios, such as punishments or challenges.
### Usage
To use the command, type `/burn <player> <ticks>`, replacing `<player>` with the target player's name and `<ticks>` with the desired duration in ticks (20 ticks = 1 second).
You can also use `/burn <ticks>` to set yourself on fire for the specified duration.
