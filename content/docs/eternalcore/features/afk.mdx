## Introduction

The `afk` command allows players to mark themselves as away from keyboard. While AFK, other players and staff will see your AFK status. The feature can be used manually or combined with server settings that automatically toggle AFK after inactivity.

## Usage

```text
/afk
→ Toggles your AFK status on or off

/afk <reason>
→ Sets AFK with an optional reason (e.g. `/afk eating`)
```
