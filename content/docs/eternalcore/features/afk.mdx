## 💤 AFK — mark yourself as away

The `afk` command allows players to mark themselves as away from keyboard. While AFK, other players and staff will see your AFK status. The feature can be used manually or combined with server settings that automatically toggle AFK after inactivity.

### ✅ Basic usage

```text
/afk
→ Toggles your AFK status on or off

/afk <reason>
→ Sets AFK with an optional reason (e.g. `/afk eating`)
```

### 🎯 Examples

```text
/afk
→ You are now AFK

/afk lunch
→ You are now AFK: lunch

# Staff view
/afk list
→ Shows players currently marked AFK (staff command)
```

## ℹ️ Notes

- AFK status is visible to other players and staff.
- Some servers may auto-mark players AFK after a period of inactivity; check your server settings for auto-AFK and auto-kick options.
- Use an optional reason to let others know why you're away.
