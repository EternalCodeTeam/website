## 🎲 Random Teleport — explore random locations

The `/rtp` (Random Teleport) command teleports you to a random safe location within a configured radius. Perfect for survival servers to help players spread out and explore.

### ✅ Basic usage

```text
/rtp [player]
/randomtp [player]
```

- Without `[player]`, teleports yourself to a random location. Requires `eternalcore.rtp` permission.
- Providing `[player]` teleports that player (requires `eternalcore.rtp.other` permission).

### 🎯 Examples

```text
/rtp
→ Teleporting to a random location...
→ You have been teleported to X: 1234, Z: -5678

/randomtp Notch
→ Notch has been teleported to a random location
```

## ℹ️ Notes

- Permission: `eternalcore.rtp` (self), `eternalcore.rtp.other` (others).
- The command finds a safe location (not in lava, water, or mid-air).
- Radius and world boundaries can be configured in the plugin settings.
- Has a default cooldown to prevent abuse (configurable). Apply `eternalcore.rtp.bypass` permission to skip cooldown.
- The teleport is canceled if no safe location is found after several attempts.
