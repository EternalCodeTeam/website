## Introduction

The `/rtp` (Random Teleport) command teleports you to a random safe location within a configured radius. Perfect for survival servers to help players spread out and explore.

## Usage

```text
/rtp [player]
/randomtp [player]
```

<AlertBox type="warning" title="Note">
  - Without `[player]`, teleports yourself to a random location.
  - Providing `[player]` teleports that player.

## Notes

- The command finds a safe location (not in lava, water, or mid-air).
- Radius and world boundaries can be configured in the plugin settings.
- Has a default cooldown to prevent abuse (configurable).
- The teleport is canceled if no safe location is found after several attempts.
