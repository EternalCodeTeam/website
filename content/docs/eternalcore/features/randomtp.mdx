## üé≤ Random Teleport ‚Äî explore random locations

The `/rtp` (Random Teleport) command teleports you to a random safe location within a configured radius. Perfect for survival servers to help players spread out and explore.

### ‚úÖ Usage

```text
/rtp [player]
/randomtp [player]
```

<AlertBox type="warning">
  - Without `[player]`, teleports yourself to a random location. Requires `eternalcore.rtp` permission.
  - Providing `[player]` teleports that player (requires `eternalcore.rtp.other` permission).
</AlertBox>

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes

- The command finds a safe location (not in lava, water, or mid-air).
- Radius and world boundaries can be configured in the plugin settings.
- Has a default cooldown to prevent abuse (configurable). Apply `eternalcore.rtp.bypass` permission to skip cooldown.
- The teleport is canceled if no safe location is found after several attempts.
