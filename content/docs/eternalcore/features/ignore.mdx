## 🚫 Ignore players — block messages and interactions
The `/ignore` command allows you to block messages and interactions from specific players on your server.
This is useful for avoiding unwanted communication, flood or harassment.

Required permission: `eternalcore.ignore`

### ✅ Usage

```
/ignore <player>
/unignore <player>
/ignore -all
/unignore -all
```

### Effects of ignoring a player
- You will not see private messages from the ignored player (/msg, /tell, /whisper).
- You will not receive any teleportation requests from the ignored player (/tpa, /tpahere).
