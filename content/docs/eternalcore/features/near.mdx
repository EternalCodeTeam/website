## Introduction

The `/near` command allows you to find and list entities within a specified radius around you or another player.
This can be useful for locating mobs, players, or other entities near you.

## Usage

```text
/near [entityScope] [radius]
```

Available entity scopes: `ALL`, `PLAYER`, `HOSTILE`, `PASSIVE`, `RAIDER`, `LIVING`, `LEASHED`

  - Default radius is 100 blocks.
  - If no entity scope is provided, it defaults to `PLAYER`.
