## Introduction

The `/freeze` command allows you to freeze a player in place by applying the powder snow effect, which slows them down and takes damage temporarily.
This can be useful for moderating gameplay or managing player behavior on your server.

## Usage

```text
/freeze <player> <time>
/unfreeze <player>
```
