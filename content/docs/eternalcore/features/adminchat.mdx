## Introduction

The `/adminchat` command allows server staff to communicate privately, keeping sensitive discussions out of the public chat.
It's ideal for coordination, moderation, and behind-the-scenes conversations between admins and moderators.

## Usage

To send a message to the admin chat, simply use the command followed by your message.

```text
/adminchat <message>
```
