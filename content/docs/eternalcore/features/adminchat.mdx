## Introduction

The `/adminchat` command lets your staff communicate privately without cluttering public chat.
It's useful for moderation, coordination, and any behind-the-scenes discussion between team members.

With EternalCore 2.0, AdminChat now supports **two modes**:
1. **Quick message mode** — send a single message to staff.
2. **Channel mode** — enable a persistent admin-only chat channel until you turn it off.

## Usage

### Quick Message
Use this when you just want to send one message to the staff channel:

```text
/adminchat <message>
````

### Channel Mode (Toggle)

You can also enter a dedicated admin chat channel.
While it’s enabled, everything you type goes directly to staff members.

```text
/adminchat
```

Run the command again to leave the channel.
