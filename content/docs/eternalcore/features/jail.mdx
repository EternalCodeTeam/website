## Introduction

Upon being jailed, players are teleported to the designated jail area and are restricted from leaving until their jail time expires or they are released by an administrator.
Once the jail time is over, players are automatically released and teleported back to their original location before being jailed.

## Usage

```text
/jail setup
/jail detain <player> <time>
/jail release <player>
/jail remove
/jail list
```

- `setup` - Sets up the jail area at the administator's current location.
- `detain` - Jails a player for a specified duration with an optional reason.
- `release` - Releases a jailed player from jail.
- `remove` - Removes the jail area.
- `list` - Lists all currently jailed players.
