## Introduction

The `/tpahere` command allows you to request another player to teleport to your current location.
This is particularly useful for quickly gathering players together without needing to move to their location.

## Usage

```text
/tpahere <player>
```
The targeted player will receive a teleport request and can choose to accept or deny it.

### Accepting/denying the request
- To accept the teleport request, the targeted player can use the command `/tpahereaccept <player>`.
- To deny the request, they can use `/tpaheredeny <player>`.

## Notes

- Players can ignore teleport requests from specific players by using the `/ignore` command.
