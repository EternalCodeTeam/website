## /tpahere command
The `/tpahere` command allows you to request another player to teleport to your current location.
This is particularly useful for quickly gathering players together without needing to move to their location.

### Usage
To use the command, type `/tpahere <player>`, replacing `<player>` with the target player's name.
The targeted player will receive a teleport request and can choose to accept or deny it.

### Accepting/denying the request
- To accept the teleport request, the targeted player can use the command `/tpahereaccept <player>`.
- To deny the request, they can use `/tpaheredeny <player>`.

### Ignoring requests
Players can ignore teleport requests from specific players by using the command `/ignore <player> command.
For more information, see the [Ignore](/docs/eternalcore/features/ignore) feature documentation.
