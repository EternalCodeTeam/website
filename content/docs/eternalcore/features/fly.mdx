## Introduction

The `/fly` command toggles the ability to fly for yourself or for a target player. Useful for staff and builders.

## Usage

```text
/fly [player]
```
- Omitting `[player]` toggles flight for the sender.
- Targeting another player toggles their flight.

## Examples

```text
/fly
→ Flight enabled/disabled for you

/fly Steve
→ Flight enabled/disabled for Steve
```

## Notes

- Flight permission toggling may also be tied to player group settings or server config; check your server policy.
