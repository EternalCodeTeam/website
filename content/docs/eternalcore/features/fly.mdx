## 🕊️ Fly — toggle player flight

The `/fly` command toggles the ability to fly for yourself or for a target player. Useful for staff and builders.

### ✅ Basic usage

```text
/fly [player]
```

- Omitting `[player]` toggles flight for the sender.
- Targeting another player requires `eternalcore.fly.other` permission.

### 🎯 Examples

```text
/fly
→ Flight enabled/disabled for you

/fly Steve
→ Flight enabled/disabled for Steve (staff only)
```

## ℹ️ Notes

- Permission: `eternalcore.fly` (self), `eternalcore.fly.other` (others).
- Flight permission toggling may also be tied to player group settings or server config; check your server policy.
