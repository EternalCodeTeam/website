## Introduction

The `/signedit` command allows you to edit the text on signs in your Minecraft server without needing to break and replace them.
This is useful for server admins, moderators, or players with appropriate permissions to quickly update sign information.

## Usage

```text
/signedit set <side> <line> <text>
```

Replace `<side>` with `FRONT` or `BACK` to specify which side of the sign to edit. Available only for >1.20 Minecraft versions.

  Unlike traditional right-click editing, the `/signedit` command allows to use formatting codes for enhanced text styles.
