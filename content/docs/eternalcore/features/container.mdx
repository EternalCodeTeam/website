## Introduction

You can open many different container-style inventories via commands. Each command opens the corresponding inventory for yourself or for another player.

## Usage

```text
/{INVENTORY_TYPE} [player]
```
- If `[player]` is omitted, the inventory opens for the command sender.
- If `[player]` is provided, the command opens the target player's inventory.

### Supported types

- anvil
- disposal
- stonecutter
- grindstone
- workbench
- loom
- cartography
- enderchest
- smithingtable

## Examples

```text
/anvil
→ Opens an anvil for you

/workbench Alex
→ Opens a workbench for player Alex

/enderchest
→ Opens your ender chest
```

## Notes

- These commands only open the UI client-side for the target player; any changes (like placing items) occur as normal within the opened inventory.
