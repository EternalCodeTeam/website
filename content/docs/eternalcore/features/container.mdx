## 🧰 Container Inventories — open special inventories with commands

You can open many different container-style inventories via commands. Each command opens the corresponding inventory for yourself or for another player (if you have permission).

Permissions follow the pattern `eternalcore.<type>` for self-use and `eternalcore.<type>.other` for opening inventories of other players. Replace `<type>` with the name, for example `eternalcore.anvil`.

### ✅ Command format

```text
/{INVENTORY_TYPE} [player]
```
- If `[player]` is omitted, the inventory opens for the command sender.
- If `[player]` is provided, the command requires the `.other` permission to open the target player's inventory.

### 🔹 Supported types

- anvil
- disposal
- stonecutter
- grindstone
- workbench
- loom
- cartography
- enderchest
- smithingtable

### 🎯 Examples

```text
/anvil
→ Opens an anvil for you

/workbench Alex
→ Opens a workbench for player Alex (requires `eternalcore.workbench.other`)

/enderchest
→ Opens your ender chest
```

## ℹ️ Notes

- Commands require the permission `eternalcore.<type>`; opening another player's inventory requires `eternalcore.<type>.other`.
- These commands only open the UI client-side for the target player; any changes (like placing items) occur as normal within the opened inventory.
