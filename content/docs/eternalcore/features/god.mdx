## 🛡️ God mode — toggle invincibility

The `/god` command toggles god mode (invincibility) for yourself or for a target player. When enabled, the player will not take any damage from any source.

### ✅ Basic usage

```text
/god [player]
```

- Omitting `[player]` toggles god mode for the sender.
- Targeting another player requires `eternalcore.god.other` permission.

### 🎯 Examples

```text
/god
→ God mode enabled/disabled for you

/god Notch
→ God mode enabled/disabled for Notch
```

## ℹ️ Notes

- Permission: `eternalcore.god` (self), `eternalcore.god.other` (others).
- While in god mode, players are immune to all damage including void damage, fire, fall damage, and PvP.
