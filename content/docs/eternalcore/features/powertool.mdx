## 🔨✨ Powertools

The Powertool feature lets you bind a command to a specific item in hand.
When a player uses that item (left or right-click), the bound command is executed automatically. This is particularly useful for shortcuts, tools, or custom item behaviours without creating custom items.

## Key points
- Binds a command to an item type (and optionally to item meta).
- Command is executed when the player uses the item.
- Supports placeholders (player, location, item info).

## Commands

Common commands (adjust names to your server's commands if different):

- Bind a command to the item in hand:
```
/powertool set <command...>
```
Example:
```
  /powertool set warp home
```
This binds `warp home` to the currently held item.

- Unbind the powertool for the item in hand:
```
/powertool
```

<AlertBox type="info">
  - Commands typed after `set` are the command that will run when the item is used.
  - Omit the slash in the binding (the plugin will add it automatically when executing). Exceptions are WorldEdit
  commands which require double slashes (e.g., `//wand`)
</AlertBox>

## Permissions

- `eternalcore.powertool.use` — allows using powertools.
- `eternalcore.powertool.assign` — allows binding commands to items.

## Placeholders

When binding a command you can use placeholders which will be replaced when the command runs. Typical placeholders:

- `{player}` — player's name
- `{WORLD}` - player's world name
- `{x}`, `{y}`, `{z}`, `yaw`, `pitch` — player's coordinates
- `{world}` — player's world name
- `{ITEM_TYPE}` — item material (e.g., DIAMOND_SWORD)
- `{ITEM_NAME}` — the name of the item
