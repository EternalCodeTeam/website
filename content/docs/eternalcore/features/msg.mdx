## 💬 Private Messages — direct player communication

The private messaging system allows players to send direct messages to each other privately. This includes commands for sending messages and replying to the last sender.
Required permissions:
- `eternalcore.msg` - to send private messages using `/msg` or `/tell
- `eternalcore.reply` - to reply to the last player who messaged you using `/reply` or `/r`

### ✅ Usage

```text
/msg <player> <message>
/tell <player> <message>
→ Send a private message to a player

/reply <message>
/r <message>
→ Reply to the last player who messaged you
```

### 🎯 Examples

```text
/msg Notch Hey, want to team up?
→ Sends a private message to Notch

/tell Steve Check out my build!
→ Sends a private message to Steve

/reply Sure, let's go!
→ Replies to the last player who sent you a message

/r Thanks!
→ Quick reply shortcut
```

### Toggling private messages
Private messages can be toggled on or off using the `/msgtoggle` command.

## ℹ️ Notes

- Private messages are only visible to the sender and recipient.
- Staff with appropriate permissions may be able to view private messages for moderation (`/socialspy`).
- Players can use `/ignore` to block messages from specific players (if the player has appropriate permission). For more information, see the [Ignoring players](./ignore) feature.
