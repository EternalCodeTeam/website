## Introduction

The private messaging system allows players to send direct messages to each other privately. This includes commands for sending messages and replying to the last sender.

## Usage

```text
/msg <player> <message>
/tell <player> <message>
→ Send a private message to a player

/reply <message>
/r <message>
→ Reply to the last player who messaged you
```

## Examples

```text
/msg Notch Hey, want to team up?
→ Sends a private message to Notch

/tell Steve Check out my build!
→ Sends a private message to Steve

/reply Sure, let's go!
→ Replies to the last player who sent you a message

/r Thanks!
→ Quick reply shortcut
```

### Toggling private messages
Private messages can be toggled on or off using the `/msgtoggle` command.

## Notes

- Private messages are only visible to the sender and recipient.
- Staff with appropriate permissions may be able to view private messages for moderation (`/socialspy`).
- Players can use `/ignore` to block messages from specific players. For more information, see the [Ignoring players](./ignore) feature.
