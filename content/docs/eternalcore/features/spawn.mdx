## 🏠 Spawn — teleport to spawn point

The `/spawn` command teleports you or another player to the server's spawn point. This is useful for returning to the main hub or starting area.

### ✅ Usage

```text
/spawn [player]
```

- Without `[player]`, teleports yourself to spawn.
- Providing `[player]` teleports that player to spawn (requires permission).

### 🎯 Examples

```text
/spawn
→ Teleporting to spawn... (requires `eternalcore.spawn` permission).
If the player does not have the `eternalcore.spawn.bypass` permission, a cooldown may apply (configurable).

/spawn Notch
→ Teleported Notch to spawn (requires `eternalcore.spawn.other` permission)
```

---

### 🛠️ Setting the spawn

Staff members can set the spawn location using:

```text
/setspawn
→ Sets the spawn point to your current location
```

## ℹ️ Notes

- Permission: `eternalcore.spawn` (teleport to spawn), `eternalcore.spawn.other` (teleport others).
- Permission to set spawn: `eternalcore.setspawn`
- May have a cooldown period before teleport (configurable).
- Teleport is canceled if you move or take damage during warmup.
