## Introduction

The `/spawn` command teleports you or another player to the server's spawn point. This is useful for returning to the main hub or starting area.

## Usage

```text
/spawn [player]
```

- Without `[player]`, teleports yourself to spawn.
- Providing `[player]` teleports that player to spawn.

## Examples

```text
/spawn
→ Teleporting to spawn...

/spawn Notch
→ Teleported Notch to spawn
```

## Setting the spawn

Staff members can set the spawn location using:

```text
/setspawn
→ Sets the spawn point to your current location
```

## Notes

- May have a cooldown period before teleport (configurable).
- Teleport is canceled if you move or take damage during warmup.
