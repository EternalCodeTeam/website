## Introduction

The `/lightning` command summons a lightning bolt at a specified location or player. This can be used for fun or as a punishment tool.

## Usage

```text
/lightning [player]
```

<AlertBox type="info" title="Note">
  - Without `[player]`, strikes lightning at your current location or where you're looking.
  - Providing `[player]` strikes lightning at that player's location.
</AlertBox>

## Examples

```text
/lightning
→ Lightning strikes at your target location

/lightning Notch
→ Lightning strikes at Notch's position
```

<AlertBox type="danger" title="Warning">
  - The lightning bolt can cause fire and damage nearby entities.
  - Use with caution in survival areas to avoid unintended destruction.
