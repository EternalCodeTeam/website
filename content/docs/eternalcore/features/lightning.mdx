## ⚡ Lightning — strike lightning bolts

The `/lightning` command summons a lightning bolt at a specified location or player. This can be used for fun or as a punishment tool.

### ✅ Basic usage

```text
/lightning [player]
```

- Without `[player]`, strikes lightning at your current location or where you're looking.
- Providing `[player]` strikes lightning at that player's location.

### 🎯 Examples

```text
/lightning
→ Lightning strikes at your target location

/lightning Notch
→ Lightning strikes at Notch's position
```
