## Introduction

The `/give` command allow you to provide items to yourself or other players on your server. This is useful for server admins, moderators, or players with appropriate permissions to obtain items quickly.
The `/item` command, on the other hand can be used **only to give items to yourself**.

## Usage

```text
/give <player> <item> [amount]
/item <item> [amount]
```
