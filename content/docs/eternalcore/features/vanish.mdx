## Introduction

The `/vanish` command allows staff to become invisible to regular players.
It's perfect for moderation, monitoring, or just moving around the server without being noticed.

With EternalCore 2.0, vanish is fully customizable via `config.yml`, giving you control over:

- Silent join
- Godmode
- Night vision
- Silent inventory access
- Glow effect color
- Block item drop / pickup
- Block hunger loss
- Block chat usage
- Block block-placing

## Usage

```text
/vanish [toggle]
````

* Running `/vanish` toggles your vanish state on or off.
* Options can be configured globally in `config.yml` or overridden per permission group.
