## 💬 Private Messages — direct player communication

The private messaging system allows players to send direct messages to each other privately. This includes commands for sending messages and replying to the last sender.

### ✅ Basic usage

```text
/msg <player> <message>
/tell <player> <message>
→ Send a private message to a player

/reply <message>
/r <message>
→ Reply to the last player who messaged you
```

### 🎯 Examples

```text
/msg Notch Hey, want to team up?
→ Sends a private message to Notch

/tell Steve Check out my build!
→ Sends a private message to Steve

/reply Sure, let's go!
→ Replies to the last player who sent you a message

/r Thanks!
→ Quick reply shortcut
```
