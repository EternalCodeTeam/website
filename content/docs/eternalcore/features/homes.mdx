## 🏠 Homes — teleport to personal locations

EternalCore Homes allows players to set their own home locations and teleport to them using simple commands. This system is permission-based and highly configurable.

```yaml
homes:
  # Default home name
  defaultHomeName: "home"
  # Time of teleportation to homes
  teleportTimeToHomes: "5s"
```

## 🔒 Limit homes based on permissions

You can assign a maximum number of homes to specific permissions using the `maxHomes` section.

It is possible to configure the maximum number of homes for a given permission.

```yaml
# Homes Section
homes:
  # Home limits per permission
  maxHomes:
    eternalcore.home.default: 1     # Default players: 1 home
    eternalcore.home.vip: 2         # VIP players: 2 homes
    eternalcore.home.premium: 3     # Premium players: 3 homes
    eternalcore.home.legend: 4      # Legend players: 4 homes
    # You can define more with the format: eternalcore.home.<unique_name>
```

🎯 Example:
A player with the permission `eternalcore.home.vip` can set **up to 2 homes**.

📌 The plugin automatically uses the highest value from all permissions a player has.

⚠️ **If a player has no matching permission, they won't be able to use homes.**

## 🛠️ Admin Homes — Manage player homes with `/homeadmin`

The `/homeadmin` command group allows server staff and administrators to fully manage homes for other players, regardless of their permission limits or online status.

### 💡 Examples

```text
/homeadmin list Steve
→ Shows all homes Steve has set

/homeadmin home Alex base
→ Teleports you to Alex’s “base” home

/homeadmin sethome Notch cave
→ Sets Notch's home named "cave" at your current location

/homeadmin delhome Herobrine lava
→ Deletes Herobrine's home named "lava"
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What happens if a player loses permission to a higher home tier?**
A: The player will no longer be able to create new homes above their new limit, but existing homes are not deleted.

**Q: Can I disable teleport delay?**
A: Yes. Set `teleportTimeToHomes: "0s"` to disable the delay completely.
