## 🏠 Homes — teleport to personal locations

Homes allow players to set their own defined locations in any world and teleport to them using simple commands. This system is permission-based and highly configurable.

```yaml
homes:
  # Default home name
  defaultHomeName: "home"
  # Time of teleportation to homes
  teleportTimeToHomes: "5s"
```

## 🔒 Limit homes based on permissions

You can assign a maximum number of homes to specific permissions using the `maxHomes` section.

It is possible to configure the maximum number of homes for a given permission.

```yaml
# Homes Section
homes:
  # Home limits per permission
  maxHomes:
    eternalcore.home.default: 1 # Default players: 1 home
    eternalcore.home.vip: 2 # VIP players: 2 homes
    eternalcore.home.premium: 3 # Premium players: 3 homes
    eternalcore.home.legend: 4 # Legend players: 4 homes
    # You can define more with the format: eternalcore.home.<unique_name>
```

🎯 Example:
A player with the permission `eternalcore.home.vip` can set **up to 2 homes**.

📌 The plugin automatically uses the highest value from all permissions a player has.

⚠️ **If a player has no matching permission, they won't be able to use the homes feature.**

## 🛠️ Manage player homes with `/homeadmin`

The `/homeadmin` command group allows server staff and administrators to fully manage homes for other players, regardless of their permission limits or online status.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What happens if a player loses permission to a higher home tier?**

A: The player will no longer be able to create new homes above their new limit, but existing homes won't be deleted.

**Q: Can I disable teleport delay?**

A: Yes, you can. To do that, set `teleportTimeToHomes: "0s"`.
