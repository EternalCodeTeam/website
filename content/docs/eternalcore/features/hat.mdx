## 🎩 Hat — wear items as hats

The `/hat` command places the block currently held in your hand onto your head as a helmet. This is purely cosmetic and allows for creative customization.

### ✅ Basic usage

```text
/hat
```

- Places the block in your hand onto your head.
- Your current helmet (if any) will be moved to your inventory.
