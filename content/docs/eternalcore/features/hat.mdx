## Introduction

The `/hat` command places the item currently held in your hand onto your head as a helmet. This is purely cosmetic and allows for creative customization.

## Usage

```text
/hat
```
- Places the item in your hand onto your head.
- Your current helmet (if any) will be moved to your inventory.
