## Disabling commands

If a command from EternalCore conflicts with a command from another plugin, you can disable it in `commands.yml`.

```yaml
rtp:
  name: []
  enabled: false
  aliases: []
  permissions: []
  subCommands: []
```

## Formatting text in chat

You can format chat messages with colors and styles using MiniMessage.

<AlertBox type="info" title="Tool">
  Check out the [MiniMessage Viewer](https://webui.advntr.dev/) for a live preview.
</AlertBox>

```yaml
message: "<gradient:#ff00ee:#f79459>Example message</gradient>"
```

## Preventing title flicker

Use the `times` key in your configuration to define fade-in, stay, and fade-out durations.

```yaml
teleportTimerFormat:
  actionbar: "<green>► <white>Teleporting in <green>{TIME}"
  chat: "<green>► <white>Teleporting in <green>{TIME}"
  title: "<white>Teleporting..."
  subtitle: "<green>{TIME}"
  # Fade-in, stay, and fade-out times. Prevents flickering.
  times: "1s 2s 1s"
```
